# Quick-JavaScript-test-

This is a quick quiz created using HTML & JavaScript for its responsiveness! Throughout the HTML code, you will notice the use of Bootstrap layouts to set the page's foundation. Bootstrap also enabled the possibility of the application being accessed on any mobile device. The JavaScript created new elements whenever the user begins the test & used "for" loops to generate and input questions &  "if"/"else" arguments based on the user's answers.
